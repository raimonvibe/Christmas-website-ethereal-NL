[Live Demo](https://christmas-website-ethereal-nl.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This project is a serene, winter-ethereal themed responsive website built with HTML5, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript, in Dutch (“NL”) locale. It adapts beautifully across desktop, tablet and mobile, offering a calm holiday-vibe experience.

## Features

* Fully responsive layout – optimised for all screen sizes.
* Ethereal design with soft colours, subtle animations and holiday imagery.
* Dutch language content (NL) – ready for the Netherlands audience.
* Built with SCSS for enhanced maintainability.
* Minimal, clean JavaScript for subtle interactive elements.
* Easy to customise (update content, colours, images) to your brand or campaign.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser.
* (Optional) Node.js & npm if tooling or build steps are involved.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raimonvibe/Christmas-website-ethereal-NL.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   cd Christmas-website-ethereal-NL
   ```
3. (Optional) If SCSS or other build tools are used, install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Open `index.html` (or the main entry file) in your browser.
5. For deployment: upload the files to your hosting provider or use a static-site deployer such as Vercel or Netlify.

## File Structure

```
/assets/
   /images/        ← Ethereal holiday-themed visuals
index.html         ← Main home page (Dutch)
about.html         ← Sample page (if included)
elements.html      ← Page showcasing design elements (if included)
...
```

## Customisation Guide

* **Colour palette**: Modify SCSS variables to alter primary, secondary or accent colours.
* **Images**: Replace files inside `/assets/images/` with your own visuals to match your unique holiday style.
* **Fonts / Icons**: Edit the `<head>` section in `index.html` to include your chosen font or icon set.
* **Language**: Since the site is Dutch (“NL”), update content strings accordingly (if you wish to adapt for other locales).
* **Deploying**: If using Vercel (as in the demo), connect your repository, choose the correct build directory, and deploy — it will handle the rest.

## Why this project?

* Provides a refined, calm holiday-website template tailored for Dutch audiences.
* Demonstrates modern responsive design techniques (fluid layouts, breakpoints, mobile-first) with a festive twist.
* Gives you an easy base to launch a seasonal campaign or personal project with minimal setup.
